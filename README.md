This are so many characters in C(hinese)J(apanese)K(orean) and It's a huge headache to deal with them. So I create this repo to make your life easier. It supports TextMeshPro for Unity.

# Known issues
1.Tested with random articles from wiki in SC/TC/J/K. Some characters are missing because I think that's acceptable for games. If you found any characters that are important but missing, feel free to fire an issue.


# Install
1. Unzip `NotoSansCJK-Regular SDF.zip`.
2. Copy unzipped `NotoSansCJK-Regular SDF.asset` to your Asset folder and let `TextMeshPro Text` use it.
